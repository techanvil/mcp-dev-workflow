## üîß Setup & Authentication

### Prerequisites

1. **Figma Account**: Access to Figma files you want to read
2. **Personal Access Token**: Required for API access

### Authentication Setup

#### Step 1: Create Figma Personal Access Token

1. **Go to Figma Account Settings:**

   - Open [Figma Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://www.figma.com/settings)
   - Click "Create new token"
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "MCP Dev Workflow")

2. **Set Token Scope:**

   - **File Access**: Read access to files you own or have been shared
   - **Read Only**: Token provides read-only access (secure)

3. **Copy Token:**
   - Save the token immediately (it won't be shown again)
   - Format: `figd_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

#### Step 2: Configure Environment

```bash
# Add to .env file
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_your_token_here

# Optional: Set default team/project for simplified commands
DEFAULT_FIGMA_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
DEFAULT_FIGMA_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Rate Limits & Performance

- **Rate Limit**: 300 requests/minute (automatically handled)
- **Asset Exports**: Limited to 10 per request (configurable)
- **File Access**: Works with any file you have view access to
- **Token Scope**: Read-only access for security

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Getting Design Specifications

```bash
# Extract design tokens as CSS custom properties
get_design_tokens with:
- file_key: "ABC123def456"
- format: "css"
- token_types: ["colors", "typography", "spacing"]

# Find all button components
get_figma_components with:
- file_key: "design-system-key"
- component_type: "COMPONENT"
- search_term: "button"
```

### Natural Language Examples

Instead of technical tool calls, you can use natural language:

- "What are the brand colors from this Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/design-system"
- "Export all icons from the UI kit as SVG files"
- "Show me the latest comments on the checkout flow design"
- "What components are available in the design system?"
- "Get typography tokens as SCSS variables"

### Extracting File Information

```bash
# Get file structure and basic info
get_figma_file with:
- file_key: "ABC123def456"

# Search for specific design elements
search_figma_layers with:
- file_key: "ABC123def456"
- search_term: "navigation"
- node_type: "COMPONENT"

# Get design feedback
get_figma_comments with:
- file_key: "feature-design-key"
```

## üìÅ Architecture

The server follows a modular architecture optimized for design workflows:

```
servers/figma/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js              # Main server entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ files.js          # File operations, comments, layer search
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components.js     # Component discovery, design tokens
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets.js         # Asset export functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.js           # Figma API authentication
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common.js         # Utilities, design token extraction
```

### Design Token Processing

The server includes sophisticated design token extraction:

- **Color Analysis**: Extracts fills, strokes, and effects
- **Typography Parsing**: Font families, weights, sizes, line heights
- **Spacing Calculation**: Margins, padding, and layout spacing
- **Format Generation**: Automatic conversion to CSS, SCSS, JSON formats

## üîí Security & Permissions

### Token Security

- ‚úÖ **Read-Only Access**: Tokens only provide read access to design files
- ‚úÖ **File-Level Permissions**: Respects Figma's existing file sharing permissions
- ‚úÖ **Team Boundaries**: Cannot access files outside your team permissions
- ‚úÖ **Secure Storage**: Store tokens in environment variables, never in code

### Best Practices

- **Rotate Tokens Regularly** for security
- **Use Team Tokens** for shared team access when available
- **Monitor Usage** to stay within rate limits
- **Principle of Least Access** - only request files you need

## üéØ Common Workflows

### Design-to-Code Implementation

```bash
# 1. Get design specifications
"Get design tokens from the design system file as CSS custom properties"

# 2. Find component specifications
"What are the button component variations and their specifications?"

# 3. Export needed assets
"Export all icons from the icon library as SVG files"

# 4. Check for updates
"Any new comments on the feature design file?"
```

### Design System Management

```bash
# Extract comprehensive design tokens
get_design_tokens with:
- file_key: "design-system-key"
- format: "scss"
- filter_pages: ["Tokens", "Colors", "Typography"]

# Audit component library
get_figma_components with:
- file_key: "component-library-key"
- component_type: "COMPONENT_SET"
```

### Design Review Process

```bash
# Check latest feedback
"Show me recent comments on the checkout flow design"

# Verify design elements
"Search for payment button components in the design file"

# Get specifications for implementation
"What are the exact color values for the error states?"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Forbidden" (403) errors:**

```bash
# Causes:
- Invalid or expired token
- Insufficient file permissions
- File is private and not shared with you

# Solutions:
- Regenerate Figma personal access token
- Check file sharing permissions
- Verify file URL is correct
```

**"Not Found" (404) errors:**

```bash
# Causes:
- File key doesn't exist
- File has been deleted
- Incorrect file URL format

# Solutions:
- Verify file URL: https://www.figma.com/file/FILE_KEY/file-name
- Check if file still exists in Figma
- Ensure file hasn't been moved or renamed
```

**Rate limit exceeded:**

```bash
# Causes:
- Too many requests in short time period
- Multiple concurrent asset exports

# Solutions:
- Wait for rate limit reset (1 minute)
- Reduce concurrent requests
- Use batch operations when available
```

### Debug Steps

1. **Test Token:**

   ```bash
   # Verify token works
   curl -H "X-Figma-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.figma.com/v1/me
   ```

2. **Check File Access:**

   ```bash
   # Test file permissions
   curl -H "X-Figma-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.figma.com/v1/files/FILE_KEY
   ```

3. **Verify File Key:**
   - File URL: `https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123def456/project-name`
   - File Key: `ABC123def456` (extract from URL)
