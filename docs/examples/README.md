## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips & Patterns

### Efficient GitHub Usage

**Default Repository Benefits:**

```bash
# Instead of repeating owner/repo
"Show me issue 2345 from google/site-kit-wp"

# Use simplified syntax
"Show me issue 2345"
```

**Smart Search Strategies:**

```bash
# Start broad, then narrow
"Search for authentication issues"
â†’ "Search for authentication label:P1"
â†’ "Search for authentication created:2025-01-01.."
```

**Pagination for Large Results:**

```bash
# Get overview first
"List recent issues" (default: 30 results)

# Then drill down
"List recent issues, show 50 results"
"List issues page 2"
```

### Effective Google Docs Usage

**URL Flexibility:**

```bash
# All of these work:
"Read https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzPZhhs.../edit"
"Read https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzPZhhs.../"
"Read document 1CzPZhhs..."
```

**Format Selection:**

```bash
# For quick reading
"Read the doc in plain text format"

# For documentation
"Read the doc in markdown format"

# For analysis (default)
"Read the doc in structured format"
```

**Search Strategies:**

```bash
# Multiple terms
"Search for 'API OR endpoint OR interface' in the doc"

# Specific sections
"Search for 'conclusion' in the doc"
"Search for 'next steps' in the doc"

# Technical terms
"Search for 'function OR method OR class' in the doc"
```
